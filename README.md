## Authors
Ishika Govil, Dea Harjianto, Aidan Conley, Taylor Fields

## Instructions for running the game
- ## Play online!
- $ https://spring-2021-cisc374.github.io/fish-out-of-water/final
- ## Start the local development server (on port 8080)
- $ npm install 
- $ npm start

## Instructions for movement in game
- Use arrow keys to move around the map. Upon entering combat, use the up and down arrow keys to pick an option, then hit space to select. If Shapeshift is selected, use the right arrow key and then hit up or down to select an animal. Then go back to using up and down arrow keys.

## Jumpstarting Game Development
- *Ishika Govil: Created the repository with a Phaser 3 template. Used Tiled to create map designs for our different levels. Found a variety of different sprites for fish to use for our game, and created an Atlas for those using TexturePacker. Implemented camaras so that the scene moves with the player. Created objects and locations in map that perform actions when collided with player. Finally, created the pipe checking mechanism for the boost scene.*
- *Dea Harjianto: Created combat sequence, including basic attack/shapeshifting logic. Implemented visual healthbar tracking system. Variety of QoL additions such as instruction scenes, combat help, information tabs for animals, and ending scene/replayability.*
- *Aidan Conley: Added movement, including changing where player "looks". Also added some sounds that will occur when playing the game, along with music for normal movement on the map, question mode, and combat mode. Also implemented in questions (and their answers) and logic that controls how they work. Also worked with Ishika in NPC/player interaction and teleporting post-answer. Additionally helped debug other aspects of game.*
- *Taylor Fields: Added pollution meter graphics and functionality to the questions provided. Created introduction screens, which are not yet fully implemented.*
## Blurb
- *Oh no! You've been flushed down the toilet by The Polluter. Can you fight the mutant fish in the sewer systems to make your way back home?*

## Short Instructions
- *Use the arrow keys to move. Find your way out of the sewer system and back home by answering questions!*
